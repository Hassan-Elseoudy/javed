A. definition of the issue and statement of relevant terms. B.
statement of roles and responsibilities
C. statement of applicability and compliance requirements.
D. statement of performance of characteristics and requirements.
Answer: D
Policies are considered the first and highest level of documentation, from which the lower level
elements of standards, procedures, and guidelines flow. This order, however, does not mean that
policies are more important than the lower elements. These higher-level policies, which are the more
general policies and statements, should be created first in the process for strategic reasons, and then
the more tactical elements can follow. -Ronald Krutz The CISSP PREP Guide (gold edition) pg 13

B. Quantifies the effect of the loss of the information. C.
Requires the identification of information owners.
D. Lists applications that support the business function.
Answer: A
Information security policies area high-level plans that describe the goals of the procedures.
Policies are not guidelines or standards, nor are they procedures or controls. Policies describe
security in general terms, not specifics. They provide the blueprints for an overall security
program just as a specification defines your next product - Roberta Bragg CISSP Certification
