<br></br>","Answer: A ""Polyinstantiation is the development of a detailed version of an object from another object usingdifferent values in the new object. In the database information security, this term is concerned with the same primary key for different relations at different classification levels being stored in thesame database. For example, in a relational database, the same of a military unit may be classifiedSecret in the database and may have an identification number as the primary key. If another user ata lower classification level attempts to create a confidential entry for another military unit using thesame identification number as a primary key, a rejection of this attempt CISSPwould imply to the lower level user that the same identification number existed at a higher levelof classification. To avoid this inference channel of information, the lower level user would beissued the same identification number for their unit and the database management system wouldmanage this situation where the same primary key was used for different units."" Pg 352-353Krutz: The CISSP Prep Guide: Gold Edition. ""As with aggregation, the best defense against inference attacks is to maintain constant vigilanceover the permissions granted to individual users. Furthermore, intentional blurring of data maybe used to prevent the inference of sensitive information."" - Ed Tittle CISSP Study Guide(sybex) The other security issue is inference, which is very similar to aggregation. The inferenceproblem happens when a subject deduces information that is restricted from data he has accessto. This is seen when data at a lower security level indirectly portrays data at a higher level...Thisproblem is usually dealt with in the development of the database by implementing content andcontext-dependent classification rules; this tracks the subject's query requests and restrictspatterns that represent inference.

<br></br>","Answer: D B1: Labeled Security Each data object must contain a classification label and each subject must have a clearance label.When a subject attempts to access an object, the system must compare the subject and object'ssecurity labels to ensure the requested actions are acceptable. Data leaving the system must alsocontain an accurate security label. The security policy is based on an informal statement and thedesign specifications are reviewed and verified. It is intended for environments that requiresystems to handle classified data. B2: Structured Protection The security policy is clearly defined and documented, and the system design andimplementation are subjected to more thorough review and testing procedures. This classrequires more stringent authentication mechanisms and well-defined interfaces among layers.Subjects and devices require labels, and the system must not allow covert channels. A trustedpath for logon and authentication processes must be in place, which means there are notrapdoors. A trusted path means that the subject is communicating directly with the application or operating system. There is no way to circumvent or compromise this communication channel.There is a separation of operator and administration functions within the system to provide moretrusted and protected operational functionality. Distinct address spaces must be provided toisolate processes, and a covert channel analysis is conducted. This class adds assurance byadding requirements to the design of the system. The environment that would require B2 systems could process sensitive data that require ahigher degree of security. This environment would require systems that are relatively resistant to CISSPpenetration and compromise. (A trusted path means that the user can be sure that he is talking to a genuine copy of theoperating system.) B3: Security Domains In this class, more granularity is provided in each protection mechanism, and the programmingcode that is not necessary to support the security policy is exclude. The design andimplementation should not provide too much complexity because as the complexity of a systemincreases, the ability of the individual who need to test, maintain, configure it reduces; thus, the overall security can be threatened. The reference monitor components must be small enough to test properly and be tamperproof. The security administrator role is clearly defined, and thesystem must be able to recover from failures without it security level being compromised. When thesystem starts up and loads it operating system and components, it must be done in an initial securestate to ensure that any weakness of the system cannot be taken advantage of in this slice of time.

These modes are set out by the Department of Defense as follows:Systems running compartmental security mode may process two or more types ofcompartmented information. All system users must have an appropriate clearance to access allinformation processed by the system but do not necessarily have a need to know all of theinformation in the system. Compartments are subcategories or compartments within the differentclassification levels and extreme care is taken to preserve the information within the differentcompartments. The system may be classified at the Secret level but contain five differentcompartments, all classified Secret. If a user has only the need to know about two of the fivedifferent compartments to do their job, that user can access the system but can only access thetwo compartments. Compartmented systems are usually dedicated systems for each specificcompartment to prevent the chance of any errors, because compartmentalization is the mostsecret of all the secrets. Systems running in the dedicated security mode are authorized to process only a specificclassification level at a time, and all system users must have clearance and a need to know thatinformation. Systems running in multilevel security mode are authorized to process information at more than CISSPone level of security even when all system users do not have appropriate clearances or a need toknow for all information processed by the system. Systems running in system-high security mode are authorized to process only information thatall system users are cleared to read and to have a valid need to know. These systems are nottrusted to maintain separation between security levels, and all information processed by thesesystems must be handled as if it were classified at the same level as the most highly classifiedinformation processed by the system.""

<br></br>","Answer: A Explanation: When comparing biometric systems, a low false acceptance rate is most important whensecurity is the priority. Whereas, a low false rejection rate is most important when con -venience is the priority. All biometric implementations balance these two criteria. Somesystems use very high FAR's such as 1 in 300. This means that the likelihood that thesystem will accept someone other than the enrolled user is 1 in 300. However, the CISSPlikelihood that the system will reject the enrolled user (its FRR) is very low, givingthem ease of use, but with low security. Most fingerprint systems should be able to runwith FARs of 1 in 10,000 or better. "

Minutia matching is a more microscopic approach CISSPthat analyzes the features of the fingerprint, such as the location and direction of the ridges, for matching. The only problem with this approach is that it is difficult to extract the minutiae points accurately if the fingerprint is in some way distorted. The more macroscopic approach is global pattern matching where the flow of the ridgesis compared at all locations between a pair of fingerprint images; however, this can beaffected by the direction that the image is rotated.

<br></br>","Answer: B Explanation: Logical attacks occur when a smartcard is operating under normal physical conditions, but sensitive information is gained by examining the bytes going to and from the smartcard. One example is the so-called ""timing attack"" described by Paul Kocher. In this attack, various byte patterns are sent to the card to be signed by the private key. Information such as the time required to perform the operation and the number of zeroes and ones in the input bytes are used to eventually obtain the private key. There are logical countermeasures to this attack but not all smartcard manufacturers have implemented them. This attack does require that the PIN to the card be known, so that many private key operations can be performed on chosen input bytes.   "

<br></br>","Answer: A Explanation: The countermeasure to prevent this attack is to use ""single-access device driver""  architecture. With this type of architectur e, the operating system enforces that only one application can have access to the serial device (and thus the smartcard) at any given time. This prevents the attack but also lessens the convenience of the smartcard because multiple applications cannot use th e services of the card at the same time. Another way to prevent the attack is by using a smartcard that enforces a ""one private key usage per PIN entry"" policy model. In this model, the user must enter their PIN every single time the private key is to be used and therefore the Trojan horse would not have access to the key.   "

A program that provides software  registration passwords or keys.  <br></br>C. A program that performs comparative analysis. <br></br>D. A program that obtains privileged access to the system. 
<br></br>","Answer: C Explanation: In a dictionary crack, L0phtCrack encrypts (i.e., hashes) all the passwords in a dictionary file you specify and compares every result with the password hash. If L0phtCrack finds any matches, it knows the password is the dictionary word. L0phtCrack comes with a default dictionary file, words-english. You can download additional files fro m the Internet or create a custom file. In the Tools Options dialog box, you can choose to run the dictionary attack against the LANMAN password hash, the NT LAN Manager (NTLM) password hash, or both (which is the default). In a hybrid crack, L0phtCrack extends the dictionary crack by appending numbers or symbols to each word in the dictionary file. For example, in addition to trying ""Galileo,"" L0phtCrack also tries ""Galileo24,"" ""13Galileo,"" ""?Galileo,"" ""Galileo!,"" and so on. The default number of characters L0phtCrack tries is two, and you can change this number in the Tools Options dialog box. In a brute-force crack, L0phtCrack tries every possible combination of characters in a character set. L0phtCrack offers four character sets, ranging from alpha only to all alphanumeric plus all symbol characters. You can choose a character set from the Character Set drop-down box in the  Itexamworld.com  CISSP    Tools Options dialog box or type a custom character set in the Character Set drop-down box.

<br></br>","Answer: A Explanation: Physical attacks occur when normal physical conditions, such as temperature, clock  frequency, voltage, etc, are altered in or der to gain access to sensitive information on the smartcard. Most smartcard operating systems write sensitive data to the EEPROM area in a proprietary, encrypted manner so that it is difficult to obtain clear text keys by directly hacking into the EEPROM. Other physical attacks that have proven to be successful involve an intense physical fluctuation at the precise time and location where the PIN verification takes place.

<br></br>","Answer: A ""Polyinstantiation is the development of a detailed version of an object from another object using different values in the new object. In the database information security, this term is concerned with the same primary key for different relations at different classification levels being stored in the same database. For example, in a relational database, the same of a military unit may be classified Secret in the database and may have an identification number as the primary key. If another user at a lower classification level attempts to create a confidential entry for another military unit using the same identification number as a primary key, a rejection of this attempt would imply to the lower level user that the same identification number existed at a higher level of classification. To avoid this inference channel of information, the lower level user would be issued the same identification number for their unit and the database management system would manage this situation where the same primary key was used for different units."" Pg 352-353 Krutz: The CISSP Prep Guide: Gold Edition. ""Polyinstantiation occurs when to or more rows  in the same table appear to have identical primary key elements but contain different da ta for use at differing classification levels. Polyinstantiation is often used as a defense against some types of inference attacks. For example, consider a database table containing the location of various naval ships on patrol. Normally, this database contains the exact position of each ship stored at the level with secret classification. However, on particular ship, the USS UpToNoGood, is on an undercover mission to a top-secret location. Military commanders do not  want anyone to know that the ship deviated from its normal patrol. If the database administrators simply change the classification of the UpToNoGood's location to top secret, a user w ith secret clearance would know that something unusual was going on when they couldn't query the location of the ship. However, if polyinstantiation is used, two records could be inserted into the table. The first one, classified at the top secret level, would reflect the true location of the ship and be available only to users with the appropriate top secret security clearance. The second record, classified at the secret level, would indicate that the ship was on routine patrol and would be returned to users with a secret clearance.""

<br></br>","Answer: A ""Database security takes a different approach than operating system security. In an operating system, the identity and authentication of the subject cont rols access. This is done through access control lists (ACLs), capability tables, roles, and security labels. The operating system only makes decisions about where a subject can access a f ile; it does not make this decisions based on the contents of the file itself. If Mitch can access f ile A, it does not matter if that file contains information about a cookie recipe or secret information from the Cold War. On the other hand, database security does look at the contents of a file when it makes an access control decision, which is referred to as content-dependent access control.

   Which one of the following properties of a transaction processing system ensures that once a transaction completes successfully (commits), the update service even if there is a system failure?  <br></br>A. Atomicity <br></br>B. Consistency <br></br>C. Isolation <br></br>D. Durability  
<br></br>","Answer: A Atomicity is correct. Consistency is not a viable answer. Atomicity states that database modifications must follow an ""all or nothing"" rule. Each transaction is said to be ""atomic."" If one part of  the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails. It is critical that the database management system maintain the atomic nature of transactions in spite of any DBMS, operating system or hardware failure. Consistency states that only valid data will be written to the database. If, for some reason, a transaction is executed that violates the database 's consistency rules, the entire transaction will be rolled back and the database will be restored to a state consistent with those rules. On the other hand, if a transaction successfully executes, it will take the database from one state that is consistent with the rules to another state that is also consistent with the rules. Isolation requires that multiple transactions o ccurring at the same time not impact each other's execution. For example, if Joe issues a transaction against a database at the same time that Mary issues a different transaction, both transactions should operate on the database in an isolated manner. The database should either perform Joe's entire transaction before executing Mary's or vice-versa. This prevents Joe's transaction from reading intermediate data produced as a side effect of part of Mary's transaction that will not eventually be committed to the database. Note that the isolation property does not ensure which tran saction will execute first, merely that they will not interfere with each other. Durability ensures that any transaction committed to  the database will not be lost. Durability is  Itexamworld.com  CISSP    ensured through the use of database backups and tran saction logs that facilitate the restoration of committed transactions in spite of any subsequent software or hardware failures.

<br></br>","Answer: A What is hardening? Naturally, there is more than one definition, but in general, one tightens control using policies which affect authorization, authentication and permissions. Nothing happens by default. You only give out permission after thinking about it, something like ""deny all"" to everyone, then ""allow"" with justification. Shut off everything, then only turn on that which must be turned on. It is not unlike locki ng every single door, window and access point in your house, then unlocking only those that need to be.

The applet is supposed to run only w ithin the sandbox. The sandbox restricts the applet's environment by restricting access to a user's hard drives and system resources. If the applet does not go outside the sandbox, it is considered safe. However, as with many other things in the computing world, the bad guys have figured out how to escape their confines and restrictions. Programmers have figured out how to write applets that enable the code to access hard drives and resource s that are supposed to be protected by the Java security scheme.

  IDSs verify, itemize, and characterize threats from: <br></br>A. Inside your organization's network. <br></br>B. Outside your organization's network.  <br></br>C. Outside and inside your organization's network. <br></br>D. The Internet. 
<br></br>","Answer: C Explanation: IDSs verify, itemize, and characterize the threat from both outside and inside your  organization's network, assisting you in  making sound decisions regarding your allocation of computer security resources. Using IDSs in this manner is important, as many people mistakenly deny that anyone (outsider or insider) would be interested in breaking into their networks. Furthermore, the information that IDSs give you regarding the source and nature of attacks allows you to make decisions regarding security strategy driven by demonstrated need, not guesswork or folklore.

  IDS can be described in terms of what fundamental functional components? <br></br>A. Response <br></br>B. Information Sources  <br></br>C. Analysis <br></br>D. All of the choices. 
<br></br>","Answer: D Explanation: Many IDSs can be described in terms of three fundamental functional components:  Itexamworld.com  CISSP    Information Sources - the different sources of event information used to determine whether an intrusion has taken place. These sources can be drawn from different levels of the system, with network, host, and application monitoring most common. Analysis - the part of intrusion detection systems that actually organizes and makes sense of the events derived from the information sources, deciding when those events indicate that intrusions are occurring or have already taken place. The most common analysis approaches are misuse detection and anomaly detection. Response - the set of actions that the system takes once it detects intrusions. These are typically grouped into active and passive measures, with active measures involving some automated intervention on the part of the system, and passive measures involving reporting IDS findings to humans, who are then expected to take action based on those reports.   "

  What are the primary goals of intrusion detection systems? (Select all that apply.) <br></br>A. Accountability <br></br>B. Availability  <br></br>C. Response <br></br>D. All of the choices 
<br></br>","Answer: A, C Explanation: Although there are many goals associated with security mechanisms in general, there are two overarching goals usually stated for intrusion detection systems. Accountability is the capability to link a given activity or event back to the party responsible for initiating it. This is essential in cases where one wishes to bring criminal charges against an attacker. The goal statement associated with accountability is: ""I can deal with security attacks that occur on my systems as long as I know who did it (and where to find them.)"" Accountability is difficult in TCP/IP networks, where the protocols allow attackers to forge the identity of source addresses or other source identifiers. It is also extremely difficult to enforce accountability in any system that employs weak identification and authentication mechanisms. Response is the capability to recognize a given activity or event as an attack and then taking action to block or otherwise affect its ultimate goal. The goal statement associated with response is ""I don't care who attacks my system as long as I can recognize that the attack is taking place and block it."" Note that the requirements of detection are quite different for response than for accountability.   "

  What is the most common way to classify IDSs? <br></br>A. Group them by information source.  Itexamworld.com  CISSP    <br></br>B. Group them by network packets. <br></br>C. Group them by attackers. <br></br>D. Group them by signs of intrusion. 
<br></br>","Answer: A Explanation: The most common way to classify IDSs is to group them by information source. Some IDSs analyze network packets, captured from network backbones or LAN segments, to find attackers. Other IDSs analyze information sources generated by the operating system or application software for signs of intrusion.   "
"546
  The majority of commercial intrusion detection systems are: <br></br>A. Identity-based <br></br>B. Network-based  <br></br>C. Host-based <br></br>D. Signature-based 
<br></br>","Answer: B Explanation: The majority of commercial intrusion detec tion systems are network-based. These IDSs detect attacks by capturing and analyzing network packets. Listening on a network segment or switch, one network-based IDS can monitor the network traffic affecting multiple hosts that are connected to the network segment, thereby protecting those hosts.   "
"547
  Which of the following is a drawback of Network-based IDSs? <br></br>A. It cannot analyze encrypted information. <br></br>B. It is very costly to setup.  <br></br>C. It is very costly to manage. <br></br>D. It is not effective. 
<br></br>","Answer: A Explanation: Network-based IDSs cannot analyze encrypted information. This problem is increasing as  more organizations (and attackers) use virtual private networks. Most network-based IDSs cannot tell whether or not an attack was successful; they can only discern that an attack was initiated. This means that after a network-based IDS detects an attack,  Itexamworld.com  CISSP    administrators must manually investigate each attacked host to determine whether it was indeed penetrated.   "
"548
  Host-based IDSs normally utilize informati on from which of the following sources? <br></br>A. Operating system audit trails and system logs. <br></br>B. Operating system audit trails and network packets.  <br></br>C. Network packets and system logs. <br></br>D. Operating system alarms and system logs. 
<br></br>","Answer: A Explanation: Host-based IDSs normally utilize information sources of two types, operating system audit trails, and system logs. Operating system audit trails are usually generated at the innermost (kernel) level of the operating system, and are therefore more detailed and better protected than system logs. However, system logs are much less obtuse and much smaller than audit trails, and are furthermore far easier to comprehend. Some host-based IDSs are designed to support a centralized IDS management and reporting infrastructure that can allow a single management console to track many hosts. Others generate messages in formats that are comp atible with network management systems.   "
"549
   When comparing host based IDS with network based ID, which of the following is an obvious advantage?  <br></br>A. It is unaffected by switched networks. <br></br>B. It cannot analyze encrypted information. <br></br>C. It is not costly to setup. <br></br>D. It is not costly to manage. 
<br></br>","Answer: A Explanation: Host-based IDSs are unaffected by switched netw orks. When Host-based IDSs operate on OS audit trails, they can help detect Trojan horse or other attacks that involve software integrity breaches. These appear as inconsistencies in process execution.   "
"550
   You are comparing host based IDS with networ k based I<br></br>D. Which of the following will you consider as an obvious disadvantage of host based IDS?   Itexamworld.com  CISSP    <br></br>A. It cannot analyze encrypted information. <br></br>B. It is costly to remove. <br></br>C. It is affected by switched networks. <br></br>D. It is costly to manage. 
<br></br>","Answer: D Explanation: Host-based IDSs are harder to manage, as in formation must be configured and managed for  every host monitored. Since at least the information sources (and sometimes part of the analysis engines) for host-based IDSs reside on the host targeted by attacks, the IDS may be attacked and disabled as part of the attack. Host-based IDSs are not well suited for detecting network scans or other such surveillance that targets an entire network, because the IDS only sees those network packets received by its host. Host-based  IDSs can be disabled by certain denial-of-service attacks.   "

Operating system audit trails and network packets. <br></br>C. Operating system audit trails and system logs. <br></br>D. Application's transaction log files. 
<br></br>",Answer: D Explanation: Application-based IDSs are a special subset of  host-based IDSs that analyze the events   Itexamworld.com  CISSP    transpiring within a software application. The most common information sources used by application-based IDSs are the app lication's transaction log files.   
"553
  Which of the following are the major categories of IDSs response options? <br></br>A. Active responses <br></br>B. Passive responses  <br></br>C. Hybrid <br></br>D. All of the choices. 
<br></br>","Answer: D Explanation: Once IDSs have obtained event information and analyzed it to find symptoms of attacks, they generate responses. Some of these responses involve reporting results and findings to a pre-specified location. Others involve more active automated responses. Though researchers are tempted to underrate the importance of good response functions in IDSs, they are actually very important. Commercial IDSs support a wide range of response options, often categorized as active responses, passive responses, or some mixture of the two.   "
"554
   Alarms and notifications are generated by IDSs to inform users when attacks are detected. The most common form of alarm is:  <br></br>A. Onscreen alert <br></br>B. Email <br></br>C. Pager <br></br>D. Icq 
<br></br>","Answer: A Explanation: Alarms and notifications are generated by IDSs to inform users when attacks are  detected. Most commercial IDSs allow users a great deal of latitude in determining how and when alarms are generated and to whom they are displayed. The most common form of alarm is an onscreen alert or popup window. This is displayed on the IDS console or on other systems as specified by the user during the configuration of the IDS. The information provided in the alarm message varies widely, ranging from a notification that an intrusion has taken place to extremely detailed messages outlining the IP addresses of the source and target of the attack, the specific attack tool used to gain access, and the outcome of the attack. Another set of options that are of utility to large or di stributed organizations are those involving  Itexamworld.com  CISSP    remote notification of alarms or alerts. These allow organizations to configure the IDS so that it sends alerts to cellular phones and pagers carried by incident response teams or system security personnel.   "

   Which of the following is a weakness of both statistical anomaly detection and pattern matching?  <br></br>A. Lack of ability to scale. <br></br>B. Lack of learning model. <br></br>C. Inability to run in real time. <br></br>D. Requirement to monitor every event. 
<br></br>","Answer: B Explanation: Disadvantages of Knowledge-based ID systems: This system is resources- intensive; the knowledge database continually needs maintenance and updates New, unique, or original attacks often go unnoticed. Disadvantages of Behavior-based ID systems: The system is characterized by high false alarm rates. High positives are the most common failure of ID systems and can create data noise that makes the system unusable. The activity and behavior of the users while in the networked system might not be static enough to effectively implement a behavior-based ID system. -Ronald Krutz The CISSP PREP Guide (gold edition) pg 88   "

   What are the primary approaches IDS takes to analyze events to detect attacks?   Itexamworld.com  CISSP    <br></br>A. Misuse detection and anomaly detection. <br></br>B. Log detection and anomaly detection. <br></br>C. Misuse detection and early drop detection. <br></br>D. Scan detection and anomaly detection. 
<br></br>","Answer: A Explanation: There are two primary approaches to analyzing events to detect attacks: misuse  detection and anomaly detection. Misuse detection, in which the analysis targets something known to be ""bad"", is the technique used by most commercial systems. Anomaly detection, in which the analysis looks for abnormal patterns of activity, has been, and continues to be, the subject of a great deal of research. Anomaly detection is used in limited form by a number of IDSs. There ar e strengths and weaknesses associated with each approach, and it appears that the most e ffective IDSs use mostly misuse detection methods with a smattering of anomaly detection components.   "
"561
   Misuse detectors analyze system activity and identify patterns. The patterns corresponding to know attacks are called:  <br></br>A. Attachments <br></br>B. Signatures <br></br>C. Strings <br></br>D. Identifications 
<br></br>","Answer: B Explanation: Misuse detectors analyze system activity, looking for events or sets of events that  match a predefined pattern of events that describe a known attack. As the patterns corresponding to known attacks are called signatures, misuse detection is sometimes called ""signature-based detection."" The most common form of misuse detection used in commercial products specifies each pattern of  events corresponding to an attack as a separate signature. However, there are more sophisticated approaches to doing misuse detection (called ""state-based"" analysis techniques) that can leverage a single signature to detect groups of attacks.   "
"562
  Which of the following is an obvious disadvantage of deploying misuse detectors? <br></br>A. They are costly to setup. <br></br>B. They are not accurate.  <br></br>C. They most be constantly updated with signatures of new attacks.  Itexamworld.com  CISSP    <br></br>D. They are costly to use. 
<br></br>","Answer: C Explanation: Misuse detectors can only detect those attacks they know about - therefore they must be constantly updated with signatures of new attacks. Many misuse detectors are designed to use tightly defined signatures that prevent them from detecting variants of common attacks. State-based misuse detectors can overcome this limitation, but are not commonly used in commercial IDSs.   "

  What detectors identify abnormal unusual behavior on a host or network? <br></br>A. None of the choices. <br></br>B. Legitimate detectors.  <br></br>C. Anomaly detectors. <br></br>D. Normal detectors. 
<br></br>","Answer: C Explanation: Anomaly detectors identify abnormal unusual behavior (anomalies) on a host or network.  They function on the assumption that attacks are different from ""normal"" (legitimate) activity and can therefore be detected by systems that identify these differences. Anomaly detectors construct profiles represen ting normal behavior of users, hosts, or network connections. These profiles are constructed from historical data collected over a period of normal operation. The detectors then collect event data and use a variety of measures to determine when monitored activity deviates from the norm.   "

<br></br>","Answer: A Explanation: Security Administration and Quality Assurance are the most similar tasks. Administrative Management: Administrative management is a very important piece of operational security. One aspect of administrative management is dealing with personnel issues. This includes separation of duties and job rotation. The objective of separation of duties is to ensure that one person acting alone cannot compromise the company's security in any way. High-risk activities should be broken up into di fferent parts and distributed to different individuals. This way the company does not need to put a dangerously high level of trust on certain individuals and if fraud were to take  place, collusion would need to be committed, meaning more than one person would have to be involved in the fraudulent activity. Separation of duties also helps to prevent many different types of mistakes that can take place if one person is performing a task from the beginning to the end. For instance, a programmer should not be the one to test her own code. A di fferent person with a different job and agenda should perform functionality and integrity tes ting on the programmer's code because the programmer may have a focused view of what the program is supposed to accomplish and only test certain functions, input values, and in certain environments. Another example of separation of duties is the difference between the functions of a computer operator versus the functions of a system administrator. There must be clear cut lines drawn between system administrator duties and computer operator duties. This will vary from environment to environment and will depend on th e level of security required within the environment. The system administrators usually have responsibility of performing backups and  Itexamworld.com  CISSP    recovery procedures, setting permissions, adding and removing users, setting user clearance, and developing user profiles. The computer operator on the other hand, may be allowed to install software, set an initial password, alter desktop configurations, and modify certain system parameters.

An example of this type of control is an aud it trail. -Ronald Krutz The CISSP PREP Guide (gold edition) pg 299   "

<br></br>","Answer: B The original answer for this question was C (assess th e communications network security) however I think the concentric circle is defining what in the krutz book is know as  the security perimeter. To this end this is a reference ""A circular security perimeter that is under the access control defines the area or zone to be protected. Preventive/physical controls include fences, badges, multiple doors (man-traps that consists of two doors physically separated so that an individual can be 'trapped' in the space between the doors after entering one of the doors), magnetic card entry systems, biometrics (for identifi cation), guards, dogs, environmental control systems (temperature, humidity, and so forth), and building and access area layout."" -Ronald Krutz The CISSP PREP Guide (gold edition) pg 13 This is a standard concentric circle model shown in Figure 1 . If you've never seen this, you haven't had a security lecture. On the outside is our perimeter. We are fortunate to have some defenses on our base. Although some bases don't have people guarding the gate s and checking IDs any longer, there's still the perception that it's tougher to commit a crime on a Naval base than it would be at GM. The point is: How much control do we have over fencing and guards? The answer: Not much. The next circle, the red circle, contains your internal access controls. For our purposes, the heart of the red circle is the computer. That's what I want to zero in on. The internal controls are the things you can do to keep people out of your PCs and off your network. http://www.chips.navy.mil/archives/96_oct/file5.htm   "

<br></br>","Answer: D ""Cryptography can be used as a security mech anism to provide confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, but not if the keys are compromised in any way. The keys can be captured, modified, corrupted, or disclosed to unauthorized individuals. Cryptography is based on a trust mode. Individuals trust each other to protect their own keys, they trust the administrator who is maintaining the keys, and they trust a server that holds, maintains and distributes the keys. Many administrators know that key management causes one of the biggest headaches in cryptographic implementation. There is more to key maintenance than using them to encrypt messages. The keys have to be distributed securely to the right entities and updated  Itexamworld.com  CISSP    continuously. The keys need to be protected as they are being transmitted and while they are being stored on each workstation and server. The keys need to be generated, destroyed, and recovered properly, Key management can be handled through manual or automatic processes. Unfortunately, many companies use cryptographic keys, but rarely if ever change them. This is because of the hassle of key management and because the network administrator is already overtaxed with other tasks or does not realize the task actually needs to take place. The frequency of use of a cryptographic key can have a direct correlation to often the key should be changed. The more a key is used, the more likely it is to be captured and compromised. If a key is used infrequently, then this risk drops dram atically. The necessary level of security and the frequency of use can dictate the frequency of the key updates. Key management is the most challenging part of cryptography and also the most crucial. It is one thing to develop a very complicated and complex algorithm and key method, but if the keys are not securely stored and transmitted, it does not really matter how strong the algorithm is.

   What size is an MD5 message digest (hash)? <br></br>A.) 128 bits <br></br>B.) 160 bits <br></br>C.) 256 bits <br></br>D.) 128 bytes  
<br></br>","Answer: A ""MD4 MD4 is a one-way hash function designed by Ron Rivest. It produces 128-bit hash, or message  Itexamworld.com  CISSP    digest, values. It is used for high-speed computation in software implementations and is optimized for microprocessors. MD5 MD5 is the newer version of MD4. It still produ ces a 128-bit hash, but the algorithm is more complex, which makes it harder to break. MD5 added a fourth round of operations to be performed during the hashing functions and makes several of it mathematical operations carry out more steps or more complexity to provide a higher level of security. MD2 MD2 is also a 128-bit one-way hash designed by Ron Rivest. It is not necessarily any weaker than the previously mentioned hash functions, but is much slower. SHA SHA was designed by NIST and NSA to be used with DSS. The SHA was designed to be used with digital signatures and was developed when a more secure hashing algorithm was required for federal application. SHA produces a 160-bit hash value, or message digest. This is then inputted into the DSA, which computes the signature for a message. The message digest is signed instead of the whole message because it is a much quicker process. The sender computes a 160-bit hash value, encrypts it with his private key (signs it), appends it to the message, and sends it. The receiver decrypts the value with the sender's public key, runs the same hashing function, and compares the two values. If the values are the same, the receiver can be sure that the message has not been tampered with in transit. SHA is similar to MD4. It has some extra mathematical functions and produces a 160-bit hash instead of 128-bit, which makes it more resistant to brute force attacks, including birthday attacks. HAVAL HAVAL is a variable-length one-way hash function and is the modification of MD5. It processes message blocks twice the size of those used in MD5; thus it processes blocks of 1,024 bits.

The CA creates a certificate with John's public key and identify information embedded. (The private/public key pair is either generated by the CA or on John's machine, which depends on the systems' configurations.

Message authentication and content modification: ""Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC): An HMAC is a hashed alogrithim that uses a key to generate a Message  Itexamworld.com  CISSP    Authentication Code (MAC). A MAC is a type of check sum that is a function of the information in the message. The MAC is generated before the message is sent, appended to the message, and then both are transmitted. At the receiving end, a MAC is generated from the message alone using the same algorithm as used by the sender and this MAC is compared to the MAC sent with the message. If they are not identical, the message was modified en route. Hashing algorithms can be used to generate the MAC and hash algorithms using keys provide stronger protection than ordinary MAC generation. Frequency analysis: Message authentication and session values do not protect against Frequency Analysis so A and B are eliminated. ""Simple substitution and transposition ciphers are vulnerable to attacks that perform frequency analysis. In every language, there are words and pa tters that are used more often than others. For instance, in the English language, the words ""the.' ""and,"" ""that,"" and ""is"" are very frequent patters of letters used in messages and conversation. The beginning of messages usually starts ""Hello"" or ""Dear"" and ends with ""Sincerely"" or ""Goodbye.""

    Itexamworld.com  CISSP    Which type of attack is based on the probab ility of two different messages using the same hash function producing a common message digest? <br></br>A.) Differential cryptanalysis <br></br>B.) Differential linear cryptanalysis <br></br>C.) Birthday attack <br></br>D.) Statistical attack  
<br></br>","Answer: C Attacks Against One-Way Hash Functions: A good hashing algorithm should not produce the same hash value for two different messages. If the algorithm does produce the same value for two distinctly different messages, this is referred to as a collision. If an attacker finds an instance of a collision, he has more information to use when trying to break the cryptographic methods used. A complex way of attacking a one-way hash function is called the birthday attack. Now hold on to your had while we go through this -- it is a bit tricky. In standard statistics, a birthday paradox exists. It goes something like this: How many people must be in the same room for the chance to be greater than even that another person has the same birthday as you?  Answer: 253 How many people must be in the same room for the chance to be greater than even that at least two people share the same birthday?  Answer: 23 This seems a bit backwards, but the difference is that in the first instance, you are looking for someone with a specific birthday date, which matches yours. In the second instance, you are looking for any two people who share the same birthday. There is a higher probability of finding two people who share a birthday than you finding another person sharing your birthday -- thus, the birthday paradox. ....This means that if an attacker has one hash value and wants to find a message that hashes to the same hash value, this process could take him years. However, if he just wants to find any two messages with the same hashing value, it could take him only a couple hours. .....The main point of this paradox and this section is to show how important longer hashing values truly are. A hashing algorithm that has a larger bit output is stronger and less vulnerable to brute force attacks like a birthday attack. Pg 554-555 Shon Harris: All-In-One Certification Exam Guide   "

<br></br>","Answer: C The transport layer defines how to address the physical locations and /or devices on the network, how to make connections between nodes, and how to handle the networking of messages. It is responsible for maintaining the end-to-end integrity and control of the session. Services located in the transport layer both segment and reassemble the data from upper-layer applications and unite it onto the same data stream, which provides end-to-end data transport services and establishes a logical connection between the sending host and destination host on a network. The transport layer is also responsible for providing  mechanisms for multiplexing upper-layer applications, session establishment, and the teardown of virtual circuits . -Ronald Krutz The CISSP PREP Guide (gold edition) pg 275-276 ""Transport Layer The agreement on these issues before transferring data helps provide more reliable data transfer, error detection and correction, and flow control and it optimizes network services needed to perform these tasks.""

<br></br>","Answer: B   Itexamworld.com  CISSP    The original answer to this question was RED however I th ink this is incorrect because  of this reason. Both Red and MPLS deal with qos/cos issues, there by increasing speed. Mpls more so the RED. However I have not been able to find any documents that state RED is a security impl ementation while MPLS is heavy used in the ISP VPN market. See this link for MPLS security http://w ww.nwfusion.com/research/2001/0521feat2.html Below are the link that are formation of the ration for this answer of B (MPLS) Congestion avoidance algorithm in which a small percentage of packets are dropped when congestion is detected and before the queue in question overflows completely http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/cisintwk/ita/r12.htm Multiprotocol Label Switching. Switching method that forwards IP traffic using a label. This label instructs the routers and the switches in the network where to forward the packets based on preestablished IP routing information http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/cisintwk/ita/m12.htm Resource Reservation Protocol. Protocol that suppo rts the reservation of resources across an IP network. Applications running on IP end systems can use RSVP to indicate to other nodes the nature (bandwidth, jitter, maximum burst, and so on) of the packet streams they want to receive. RSVP depends on IPv6. Also known as Resource Reservation Setup Protocol. http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/cisintwk/ita/r12.htm Random Early Detection (RED) is the recommended approach for queue congestion management in routers (Braden et al., 1998). Although in its basic form RED can be implemented in a relatively short C program, as the speed of ports and the number of queues per port increase, the implementation moves more and more into hardware. Different vendors choose different ways to implement and support RED in their silicon implementations. The degree of programmability, the number of queues, the granularity among queues, and the calculation methods of the RED parameters all vary from implementation to implementation. Some of these differences are irrelevant to the behavior of the algorithm-and hence to the resulting network behavior. Some of the differences, however, may result in a very different behavior of the RED algorithm-and hence of the network efficiency. http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/routers/ ps167/products_white_paper09186a0080091fe4.shtml Based on label swapping, a single forwarding m echanism provides opportunities for new control paradigms and applications. MPLS Label Forwar ding is performed with a label lookup for an incoming label, which is then swapped with the outgoing label and finally sent to the next hop. Labels are imposed on the packets only once at the edge of the MPLS network and removed at the other end. These labels are assigned to packets based on groupings or forwarding equivalence classes (FECs). Packets belonging to the same FEC get similar treatment. The label is added between the Layer 2 and the Layer 3 header (in a packet environment) or in the virtual path identifier/virtual channel identifier (VPI/VCI) fiel d (in ATM networks). The core network merely reads labels, applies appropriate services, and fo rwards packets based on the labels. This MPLS lookup and forwarding scheme offers the ability to explicitly control routing based on destination and source addresses, allowing easier introduction of new IP services. http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/iosw/prodlit/xlsw_ds.htm   "

<br></br>","Answer: D This is a sort of iffy question. Hardware allows faster performance then software and does not need to utilize an underlying OS to make the security software operate. (An example is PIX firewall vs checkpoint). The meantime to failure answer to me is ok but the hardware that the software security also has a MTFF. A few people looked over this question and had no problem with the answer of B (meantime to failure question) but as I looked into it I have picked D. MTTF is typical the time to failure. ""MTFF is the expected typical functional lifetime of the device given a specific operating environment"" (- Ed  Tittle CISSP Study Guide (sybex) pg 657). This leads me to think that this question says hardware has a SHORTER lifespan then software. Thus I am going to have to go with D (higher performance). This can be because of ASICs. As always uses your best judgment, knowledge and experience on this question. Below are some points of view. Few things to consider when deploying software based firewall: Patching OS or firewall software could bring down firewall or open additional holes OS Expertise vs. firewall expertise (you may need two administrators). Support contract (One for hardware, one for OS, one for firewall), who do you call? Administration (One for OS and one for firewall). If your not an expert in both then forget it. High-availability (Stateful failover) (usually requires additional software and costs a lot of money). As a result it adds to support costs. Is software firewalls a bad idea it depends. Every situation is different. -Bob http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/105/322401/2003-05-22/2003-05-28/2 A software firewall application is designed to be installed onto an existing operating system running on generic server or desktop hardware. The application may or may not 'harden' the underlying operating system by replacing core components. Typical host operating systems include Windows NT, 2000 server or Solaris. Software firewall applications all suffer from the following key disadvantages: They run on a generic operating system that may or may not be hardened by the Firewall installation itself. A generic operating system is non-specialized and more complex than is necessary to operate the firewall. This leads to reliability problems and hacking opportunities were peripheral/unnecessary services are kept running.  Itexamworld.com  CISSP    Generic operating systems have their own CPU and memory overheads making software based firewalls slower than their dedicated hardware counterparts. If the software firewalls uses PC hardware as the host platform, then there may be additional reliability problems with the hardware itself. S ub-optimal performance of generic hardware also affects software applications bundled with their own operating systems. There is no physical or topological separation of the firewalling activity. A dedicated hardware firewall is a software firewall application and operating system running on dedicated hardware. This means the hardware used is optimized for the task, perhaps including digital signal processors (DSPs) and several network interfaces. There may also be special hardware used to accelerate the encryption/decryp tion of VPN data. It may be rack mounted for easy installation into a comms' cabinet. We recommend dedicated hardware firewalls as they offer several key advantages over software applications: Dedicated hardware is typically more reliable. Hardware firewalls are simpler, hence more secure. Hardware firewalls are more efficient and offer superior performance, especially in support of VPNs.

<br></br>","Answer: A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). An encryption technology that is used to provide secure transactions such as the exchange of credit card numbers. SSL is a socket layer security protocol and is a two-layered protocol that contains the SSL Record Protocol and the SSL Handshake Protocol. Similiar to SSH, SSL uses symmetric encryption for private connections and asymmetric or public key cryptography (certificates) for peer authentication. It also uses a Message Authentication Code for message integrity checking. Krutz: The CISSP Prep Guide pg. 89. It prevents a man in the middle attack by confirming that you are authenticating with the server desired prior entering your user name and password. If the server was not authenticated, a man-in-the-middle could retrieve the username and password then use it to login. The SSL protocol has been known to be vulnerable to some man-in-the-middle attacks. The attacker injects herself right at the beginning of the authentica tion phase so that she obtains both parties' keys. This enables her to decrypt and view messages that were not intended for her. Using digital signatures during the session-key exchange can circumvent the man-in-the-middle attack. If using kerberos, when Lance and Tanya obtain each other's public keys from the KDC, the public keys are signed by the KDC. Because  Tanya and Lanace have the public key of the KDC, they both can decrypt and verify the signature on each other's public key and be sure that it came from the KDC itself. Because David does not have the private key of the KDC, he cannot substitute his pubic key during this type of transm ission. Shon Harris All-In-O ne CISSP Certification pg. 579.

<br></br>","Answer: D This is a question that I disagreed with. The pr emises that SSH does use RSA and 3DES, thus susceptible to cryptographic attack (namely birthd ay attach) has merit but I think the answer is more simple, in that you SSH cant protect against a compromised source/destination. You can safely rule out spoofing and manipulation (that is the job of ssh to protect the transmission). Original answer was C birthday attack. Use your best judgment based on knowledge and experience. The use of ssh helps to correct these vulnerab ilities. Specifically, ssh protects against these attacks: IP spoofing (where the spoofer is on either a remote or local host), IP source routing, DNS spoofing, interception of cleartext password s/data and attacks based on listening to X authentication data and spoofed connections to an X11 server. http://www-arc.com/sara/cve/SSH_vulnerabilities.html Birthday attack - Usually applied to the probability of two different messages using the same message digest, finding another message that when passed through the same hash function generates the same specific message digest.

<br></br>","Answer: B Active attacks find identities by being a man-in-the-middle or by replacing the responder in the negotiation. The attacker proceeds through the key negotiation with the attackee until the attackee has revealed its identity. In a well-designed system, the negotiation will fail after the attackee has revealed its identity because the attacker cannot spoof the identity of the originally-intended system. The attackee might then suspect that there was an attack because the other side failed before it gave its identity.

   Which of the following is true related to network sniffing? <br></br>A.) Sniffers allow an attacker to monitor data passing across a network. <br></br>B.) Sniffers alter the source address of a comput er to disguise and exploit weak authentication methods. <br></br>C.) Sniffers take over network connections <br></br>D.) Sniffers send IP fragments to a system that overlap with each other.  Itexamworld.com  CISSP      
<br></br>","Answer: A  Explanation: Sniffing is the action of capture / monitor the traffic going over the network. Because, in a normal networking environment, account and password information is passed along Ethernet in clear-text, it is not hard for an intruder to put a machine into promiscuous mode and by sniffing, compromise all the machines on the net by capturing password in an illegal fashion.

<br></br>","Answer: B ""[SYN Flood] Attackers can take advantage of th is design flaw by continually sending the victim SYN messages with spoofed packets. The victim will commit the necessary resources to setup this communication socket, and it will send its  SYN/ACK message waiti ng for the ACK message in return. However, the victim will never r eceive the ACK message, because the packet is  Itexamworld.com  CISSP    spoofed, and victim system sent the SYN/ACK message to a computer that does not exist. So the victim system receives a SYN message, add it dutif ully commits the necessary resources to setup a connection with another computer. This connection is queued waiting for the ACK message, and the attacker sends another SYN message. The victim system does what is supposed to can commits more resources, sends the SYN/ACK message, and queues this connection. This may only need to happen a dozen times before the victim system no longer has the necessary resources to open up another connection. This makes the victim computer unreachable from legitimate computers, denying other systems service from the victim computer."" Pg. 735 Shon Harris CISSP All-In-One Exam Guide   "

  What attack is typically used for identifying the topology of the target network? <br></br>A. Spoofing <br></br>B. Brute force  <br></br>C. Teardrop <br></br>D. Scanning 
<br></br>","Answer: D Explanation: Flaw exploitation attacks exploit a flaw in the target system's software in order to cause a processing failure or to cause it to exhaust system resources. An example of such a processing failure is the 'ping of death' attack. This attack involved sending an unexpectedly large ping packet to certain Windows systems. The target system could not handle this abnormal packet, and a system crash resulted. With respect to resource exhaustion attacks, the resources targeted include CPU time, memory, disk space, space in a special buffer, or network bandwidth. In many cases, simply patching the software can circumvent this type of DOS attack.   "

   A country that fails to legally protect personal data in order to attract companies engaged in collection of such data is referred to as a  <br></br>A. data pirate <br></br>B. data haven <br></br>C. country of convenience <br></br>D. sanctional nation  
<br></br>","Answer: B Correct answer is B. Data Haven. Data Haven A place where data that cannot legally be kept can be stashed for later use; an offshore web host. This is an interesting topic; companies often need information that they are not legally allowed to know. For example, some hospitals are not a llowed to mark patients as HIV positive (because it stigmatizes patients); staff members create codes or other ways so can take the necessary steps to protect themselves. http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=279 DATA HAVEN This phrase has been around for at least 15 years, but only in a specialist way. One sense is that of a place of safety and security for electronic information, for example where encrypted copies of crucial data can be stored as a backup away from one's place of business. But it can also mean a site in which data can be stored outside the ju risdiction of regulatory authorities. This sense has come to wider public notice recently as a result of Neal Stephenson's book Cryptonomicon, in which the establishment of such a haven in South East Asia is part of the plot. In a classic case of life imitating art, there is now a proposal to set up a data haven on one of the old World War Two forts off the east coast of Britain, which declared independence under the name of Sealand back in 1967 (it issues its own stamps and money, for example). The idea is to get round a proposed British law-the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill (RIP)-that would force firms to hand over decryption keys if a crime is suspected and make Internet providers install equipment to allow interception of e-mails by the security services. The Privacy Act doesn't protect information from being transferred from New Zealand to data havens-countries that don't have adequate privacy protection. [Computerworld, May 1999] The government last night poured cold water on a plan by a group of entrepreneurs to establish a ""data haven"" on a rusting iron fortress in the North Sea in an attempt to circumvent new anti-cryptography laws.

The character string ""DES-ECB"" within an encapsulated PEM header field indicates use of this algorithm/mode combination. A compliant PEM implementation supporting symmetric key management shall support this algorithm/mode combination. This mode of DES encryption is the best suited for database encryption because of its low overhead. ECB Mode has some weakness, here they are: 1. ECB Mode encrypts a 64-bit block independently of all other 64-bit blocks 2. Given the same key, identical plaintext will encrypt the same way 3. Data compression prior to ECB can help (as with any mode) 4. Fixed block size of 64 bits therefore incomplete block must be padded   "

Examples of these controls include: Access control software. Antivirus software. Library control systems. Password and password management Smart cards. Encryption. Dial-up access control and callback sytems About Passwords: Passwords are used to verify that  the user of an ID is the owner of the ID. The ID-password combination is unique to each user and therefore provides a means of holding users accountable for their activity on the system. Fixed passwords that are used for a defined period of time are often easy for hackers to compromise;  therefore, great care must be exercised to ensure that these passwords do not appear in any dictionary. Fixed passwords are often used to control access to specific data bases.  Itexamworld.com  CISSP    In this use, however, all persons who have authorized access to the data base use the same password; therefore, no accountability can be achieved. Currently, dynamic or one-time passwords, which are different for each log-on, are preferred over fixed passwords. Dynamic passwords are created by a token that is programmed to generate passwords randomly. The management of those passwords is part of Preventive control.   "

  Which of the following is not a weakness of symmetric cryptography? <br></br>A. Limited security <br></br>B. Key distribution  <br></br>C. Speed <br></br>D. Scalability  
<br></br>","Answer: C  Explanation: In secret key cryptography, a single key is used for both encryption and decryption. The sender uses the key (or some set of rules) to encrypt the plaintext and sends the cipher text to the receiver. The receiver applies the same key (or rule set) to decrypt the message and recover the plaintext. Because a single key is used for both functions, secret key cryptography is also called symmetric encryption. With this form of cryptography, it is obvious that the key must be known to both the sender and the receiver ; that in fact, is the secret. The biggest difficulty with this approach, of course, is the distribution of the key. Symmetric encryption is around 1000 times faster than Asymmetric encryption, the second is commonly used just to encrypt the keys for Symmetric Cryptography.   "

<br></br>","Answer: B  Explanation: The TCP/IP reference model is the network model used in the current Internet architecture. It has its origins back in the 1960's with the grandfather of the Internet, the ARPANET. This was a research network sponsored by the Department of Defense in the United States. The reference model was named after two of its main protocols, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol). They choose to build a packet-switched network based on a connectionless internet layer. Here is a representation of it: ""The TCP/IP Protocol Model is similar to the OSI model, but it defines only the following four layers instead of seven: Application Layer. Consists of the applications and processes that use the network.  Host-to-Host Transport Layer. Provides end-to-end data delivery service to the Application Layer. Internet Layer.

  What are database views used for? <br></br>A. To ensure referential integrity. <br></br>B. To allow easier access to data in a database.  <br></br>C. To restrict user access to data in a database. <br></br>D. To provide audit trails.  
<br></br>","Answer: C  Explanation: Through the use of a view we can provide security for the organization restricting users access to certain data or to th e real tables containing the information in our database. For example, we can create a view that brings data from 3 tables, only showing 2 of the 4 columns in each. Instead of  giving access to the tables that contain the information, we give access to the view, so th e user can access this fixed information but does not have privileges over the tables containing it. This provides security.   "

  Intrusion detection has which of the following sets of characteristics. <br></br>A. It is adaptive rather than preventive. <br></br>B. It is administrative rather than preventive.  <br></br>C. It is disruptive rather than preventative. <br></br>D. It is detective rather than preventative.  
<br></br>","Answer: D  Explanation: This is one of the features of in trusion detections, instead of being pro-active, it has a reactive behavior. When we set an IDS system inside of our network or hosts, the IDS agent is constantly monitoring in real time what activities are being performed in the infrastructure. If the IDS founds a malicious  activity taking place it can take actions against it like disabling interfaces, alerting the administrators or sending network attacks to the source to put it out of service. As a difference to the detective behavior of IDS, we can also increase the security with practices like hardening our systems ,this is considered a preventive practice.   "

   Which type of password provides maximum secu rity because a new password is required for each now log-on is defined to as?  <br></br>A. One-time or dynamic password <br></br>B. Cognitive password <br></br>C. Static password <br></br>D. Pass phrase  
<br></br>","Answer: A  Explanation: ""One-time"" or ""dynamic"" password technology concept is having your remote host already know a password that is not going to go over insecure channels and when you connect, you get a challenge. You take the challenge information and password and plug it into an algorithm which generates the response that should get the same answer if the password is the same on the both sides. Therefore the password never goes over the network, nor is the same challenge used twice. Unlike SecurID or SNK, with S/key you do not share a secret with the host. Other one time password technology is card systems where each user gets a card that generates   Itexamworld.com  CISSP    numbers that allow access to their account. Without the card, it is improbable to guess the numbers.   "

<br></br>","Answer: B  Explanation: Tokens are usually used to provide authentication through ""What we have"", is most commonly implemented to provide two-factor authentication. For example, SecurID requires two pieces of information, a password and a token. The token is usually generated by the SecurID token - a small electro nic device that users keep with them that display a new number every 60 seconds. Combining this number with the users password allows the SecurID server to determine whatev er or not the user should be granted access.   "

   Which of the following uses a directed graph to specify the rights that a subject can transfer to an object, or that a subject can take from another subject?  <br></br>A. Take-Grant model <br></br>B. Access Matrix model <br></br>C. Biba model <br></br>D. Bell-Lapadula model  
<br></br>","Answer: A  Explanation: The Take-Grant System is a model that helps in determining the protection rights (e.g., read or write) in a computer system. The Take-Grant system was introduced by Jones, Lipton, and Snyder to show that it is possible to decide on the safety of a computer system even when the number of subjects and objects are very large, or unbound. This can be accomplished in linear time based on the initial size of the system. The take-grant system models a protection system which consists of a set of states and state transitions. A directed graph shows the connections between the nodes of this system. These nodes are representative of the subjects or objects of the model. The directed edges between the nodes represent the rights that one node has over the linked node.   "

   Why does compiled code pose more risk than interpreted code?  <br></br>A. Because malicious code can be embedded in the compiled code and can be difficult to detect. <br></br>B. Because the browser can safely execute all interpreted applets. <br></br>C. Because compilers are not reliable. <br></br>D. It does not. Interpreted code poses more risk than compiled code. 
<br></br>","Answer: A Explanation: Since the compiled code has already been translated to binary language (the language understanded natively by the computers), its very difficult for us (the humans) to detect malicious code inside an application, this is because its not apparently visible, you have to find that malicious code through the behavior of the program. Instead, when we talk about Interpreted code, we use a language in terpreter, that is a piece of software that allows the end-user to write a program in some human-readable language, and have this program executed directly by the interpreter. This is in contrast to language compilers, that translate the human-readable code into machine-readable code, so that the end-user can execute the machine-readable code at a later time.This is far more easier to detect malicious code inside the programs, you just need to see what piece of code produced the undesired action.

  Why would anomaly detection IDSs often generate a large number of false positives? <br></br>A. Because they can only identify correctly attacks they already know about.  Itexamworld.com  CISSP    <br></br>B. Because they are application-based are more subject to attacks. <br></br>C. Because they cant identify abnormal behavior. <br></br>D. Because normal patterns of user and system behavior can vary wildly. 
<br></br>","Answer: D Explanation: One of the most obvious reasons why false alarms occur is because tools are stateless. To detect an intrusion, simple pattern  matching of signatures is often insufficient. However, that's what most tools do. Then, if the signature is not carefully designed, there will be lots of matches. For example, tools detect attacks in sendmail by looking for the words ""DEBUG"" or ""WIZARD"" as the first word  of a line. If this is in the body of the message, it's in fact innocuous, but if the tool doesn't differentiate between the header and the body of the mail, then a false alarm is generated. Finally, there are many events happening in the course of the normal life of any system or network that can be mistaken for attacks. A lot of sysadmin activity can be catalogued as anomalous. Therefore, a clear correlation between attack data and administrative data should be established to cross-check that everything happening on a system is actually desired. Normal patterns and user activities are usually  confused with attacks by IDS devices, its expected that the 2nd generations IDS system s will decrease the percent of false positives.   "

    Itexamworld.com  CISSP    What attack involves the perpetrator sending spoofed packet(s) with the SYN flag set to the victim's machine on any open port that is listening?  <br></br>A. Bonk attack <br></br>B. Land attack <br></br>C. Teardrop attack <br></br>D. Smurf attack  
<br></br>","Answer: B  Explanation: The Land attack involves the perpetrator sending spoofed packet(s) with the SYN flag set to the victim's machine on any open port that is listening. If the packet(s) contain the same destination and source IP a ddress as the host, the victim's machine could hang or reboot. In addition, most systems experience a tota l freeze up, where as CTRL-ALT-DELETE fails to work, the mouse and keyboard become non operational and the only method of correction is to reboot via a reset button on the system or by turning the machine off. Vulnerable Systems: This will affect almost all Windows 95, Windows NT, Windows for Workgroups systems that are not properly patched and allow Net Bios over TCP/IP. In addition, machines running services such as HTTP, FTP, Identd, etc that do not filter packet(s), that contain the same source / destinat ion IP address, can still be vulnerable to attack through those ports. Prevention: This attack can be prevented for open / listening ports by filtering inbound packets containing the same source / destination IP address at the router or firewall level. For most home users not running a lot of services, and for those who use IRC, disabling the Identd server within their client will stop most a ttacks since the identd service (113) is becoming the most attacked service/port.

The group-dynamics as they relate to the master-slave role in the organization.  
<br></br>","Answer: B  Explanation: An access control model defines a computer and/or network system's rules for user access to information resources. Acce ss control models provide confidentiality, integrity and also provide accountability through audit trails. An audit trail documents the access of an object by a subject with a record of what operations were performed. Operations include: read, write, execute and own. Non-Discretionary Access Control is usually  role-based, centrally administered with authorization decisions based on the roles individuals have within an organization (e.g. bank teller, loan officer, etc. in a banking model). A system's security administrator grants and/or revokes system privileges based on a user's role. This model works well for corporations with a large turnover of personnel.   "

   Which of the following is a disadvantage of a behavior-based ID system?  <br></br>A. The activity and behavior of the users while in the networked system may not be static enough to effectively implement a behavior-based ID system. <br></br>B. The activity and behavior of the users while in the networked system may be dynamic enough to effectively implement a behavior-based ID system.  Itexamworld.com  CISSP    <br></br>C. The activity and behavior of the users while in the networked system may not be dynamic enough to effectively implement a behavior-based ID system. <br></br>D. The system is characterized by high fals e negative rates where intrusions are missed. 
<br></br>","Answer: A Explanation: Behavior-based intrusion detection techniques assume that an intrusion can be detected by observing a deviation from normal or expected behavior of the system or the users. The model of normal or valid behavior is extracted from reference information collected by various means. The intrusion detect ion system later compares this model with the current activity. When a deviation is observed, an alarm is generated. In other words, anything that does not correspond to a previously learned behavior is considered intrusive. The high false alarm rate is generally cited as the main drawback of behavior-based techniques because the entire scope of the behavior of an information system may not be covered during the learning phase. Also, behavior can change over time, introducing the need for periodic online retraining of the behavior profile, resulting either in unavailability of the intrusion detection system or in additional false alarms. To get the most out of this kind of IDS you need to have very static behavior  on your network and the user actions, this is because any new thing is considered dangerous , providing many false-positives but increased security. If you are in a very ""dynamic"" environment these kind of IDS system is not recommended.   "

  Which of the following statements pertaining to VPN protocol standards is false? <br></br>A. L2TP is a combination of PPTP and L2F. <br></br>B. L2TP and PPTP were designed for single point-to-point client to server communication.  <br></br>C. L2TP operates at the network layer. <br></br>D. PPTP uses native PPP authentication and encryption services. 
<br></br>","Answer: C Explanation: The Layer 2 Tunnel Protocol (L2TP) is an emerging Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard that combines the best features of two existing tunneling protocols: Cisco's Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F) and Microsoft's Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP). L2TP is an extension to the Point-to-Point Pr otocol (PPP), which is an important component for VPNs. VPNs allow users and telecommuters to connect to their corporate intranets or extranets. VPNs are co st-effective because users can connect to the Internet locally and tunnel back to connect to corporate resources. This not only reduces overhead costs associated with traditional remote access methods, but also improves flexibility and scalability. PPTP and L2TP are Layer 2 tunneling protocols; both encapsulate the payload in a Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) frame to be sent across an intermediate network.     Itexamworld.com  CISSP    "

  What is the most critical characteristic of a biometric identifying system? <br></br>A. Perceived intrusiveness <br></br>B. Storage requirements  <br></br>C. Accuracy <br></br>D. Reliability  
<br></br>","Answer: C  Explanation: The principle of biometrics is to use some unique characteristic to identify whether the person is who they say they are. Biometrics works by matching or verifying a person's unique traits with stored data in two categories: physiological characteristics and those that are behavioral. Physical indicators in clude iris, fingerprint, facial, or hand geometry. Behavior types are usually voiceprints, keystroke dynamics and handwritten signatures. Most biometric technologies require special hard ware to convert analog measurements of signatures, voices, or patterns of fingerprints and palm prints, to digital measurement, which computers can read. The biggest characteristic and problem of biometric implementations today is the accuracy, we must see the level of accuracy before buying a solution, because the technology is not perfect at this time and it can be erroneous sometimes.

   RAID Software can run faster in the operating system because neither use the hardware-level parity drives by?  <br></br>A. Simple striping or mirroring. <br></br>B. Hard striping or mirroring. <br></br>C. Simple hamming code parity or mirroring. <br></br>D. Simple striping or hamming code parity. 
<br></br>","Answer: A Explanation: This is true, if we do not use parity in ou r RAID implementation, like RAID 1 (Mirroring)  or RAID 0 (Stripping) we can improve performance because the CPU does not need waste cycles to make the parity calculations. For example this can be achieved in Windows 2000 server through the use of RAID 0 (No fault tolerance, just stripping in 64kb chunks) or RAID 1 (Mirroring through a file system driv er). This is not the case of RAID 5 that actually use parity to provide fault tolerance.   "

  What uses a key of the same length as the message? <br></br>A. Running key cipher <br></br>B. One-time pad  <br></br>C. Steganography <br></br>D. Cipher block chaining  
<br></br>","Answer: B  Explanation: The one time pad is the most secure, and one of the simplest of all  Itexamworld.com  CISSP    cryptographic methods. It was invented and patented just after World War I by Gilbert Vernam (of AT&T) and Joseph Mauborgne (USA, later chief of the Signal Corps). The fundamental features are that the sender and receiver each have a copy of an encryption key, which is as long as the message to be encrypted, and each key is used for only one message and then discarded. That key must be random, that is without pattern, and must remain unknown to any attacker. In addition, the key must never be reused, otherwise the cipher becomes trivially breakable. One of its features it's the key length, it's the same as the message.   "

  Which of the following protocols operates at the session layer (layer 5)? <br></br>A. RPC <br></br>B. IGMP  <br></br>C. LDP <br></br>D. SPX  
<br></br>","Answer: A  Explanation: The socket method of network use is a message-based system, in which one process writes a message to another. This is a long way from the procedural model. The remote procedure call is intended to act like a procedure call, but to act across the network transparently. The process makes a remote procedure call by pushing its parameters and a return address onto the stack, and jumping to the start of the procedure. The procedure itself is responsible for accessing and using the network. Af ter the remote execution is over, the procedure jumps back to the return address. The calling pr ocess then continues.

  Which of the following are NOT a countermeasure to traffic analysis? <br></br>A. Padding messages <br></br>B. Eavesdropping  <br></br>C. Sending noise <br></br>D. Covert channel analysis  
<br></br>","Answer: B  Explanation: Lets do this with a elimination process. With padding messages you can countermeasure traffic analysis because you add garbage information to the message to let in end in a fixed length, this can confuse the analyzer. Sending noise on the communication line could also countermeasure analysis because the analyzer don't now how to differentiate between real information and noise.

   How do the Information Labels of Compartmented Mode Workstation differ from the Sensitivity Levels of B3 evaluated systems?  Itexamworld.com  CISSP      <br></br>A. Information Labels in CMW are homologous to Sensitivity Labels, but a different term was chosen to emphasize that CMW's are not described in the Orange Book. <br></br>B. Information Labels contain more informati on than Sensitivity Labels, thus allowing more granular access decisions to be made. <br></br>C. Sensitivity Labels contain more information than Information Labels because B3+ systems should store more sensitive data than workstations. <br></br>D. Information Labels contain more information than Sensitivity Labels, but are not used by the Reference Monitor to determine access permissions. 
<br></br>","Answer: D Explanation: The primary goal of the compartmented mode workstation (CMW) project was to articulate the security requirements that workstations must meet to process highly classified intelligence data. As a basis for the validity of the requirements developed, a prototype was implemented which demonstrated that workstations could meet the requirements in an operationally useful manner while still remaining binary compatible with off-the-shelf software. The security requirements not only addressed traditional security concerns but also introduced concepts in areas such as labeling and the use of a trusted window management system. The CMW labeling paradigm is based on associating two types of security labels with objects : sensitivity levels and information labels. Sensitivity levels describe the levels at which ob jects must be protected. Information labels are used to prevent data over classification and also provide a mechanism for associating with data those markings that are required for accurate data labeling, but which play no role in access control decisions. The use of a trusted window manager allows users to easily operate at multiple sensitivity levels and provides a convenient mechanism for communicating security information to users in a relatively unobtrusive manner. Information labels are not used by reference monitor, permissions are referenced in Sensibility labels.   "

  Access Control techniques do not include which of the following choices? <br></br>A. Relevant Access Controls <br></br>B. Discretionary Access Control  <br></br>C. Mandatory Access Control <br></br>D. Lattice Based Access Control  
<br></br>","Answer: A  Explanation: Relevant Access Controls are not included as a Access Control Technique. Lattice-based access control models were developed in the early 1970s to deal with the confidentiality of military information. In the la te 1970s and early 1980s, researchers applied these models to certain integrity concerns. Later, applic ation of the models to the Chinese Wall policy, a confidentiality policy unique to the commercial sector, was demonstrated. Discretionary control is the most common type of access control mechanism implemented in computer systems today. The basis of this kind of security is that an individual user, or program operating on the user's behalf, is allowed to speci fy explicitly the types of access other users (or programs executing on their behalf) may have to information under the user's control. Discretionary Access control security differs from mandatory access control security in that it implements the access control decisions of the user . Mandatory controls are driven by the results of a comparison between the user's trust level or clearance and the sensitivity designation of the information.     Itexamworld.com  CISSP    "

   This type of backup management provides a continuous on-line backup by using optical or tape ""jukeboxes"", similar to WORMs, (Write Once, Read Many)  <br></br>A. Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM). <br></br>B. Hierarchical Resource Management (HRM). <br></br>C. Hierarchical Access Management (HAM). <br></br>D. Hierarchical Instance Management (HIM). 
<br></br>","Answer: A Explanation: Hierarchical Storage Management originated in the mainframe world where it was used to minimize storage costs. The HSM name signifies that the software has the intelligence to move files along a hierarchy of st orage devices that are ranked in terms of cost per megabyte of storage, speed of storage and retrieval, and overall capacity limits. Files are migrated along the hierarchy to less expensive forms of storage based on rules tied to the frequency of data access. File migration and retrieval is transparent to users. Two major factors, data access response time and storage costs determine the appropriate combination of storage devices used in HSM. A typical three tier strategy may be composed of hard drives as primary storage on the file servers, rewritable optical as the secondary storage type, and tape as the final tertiary storage location. If faster access is required, a hard drive can be considered as an alternative to optical for secondary storage, and WORM (Write Once, Read Many) optical can also be implemented, in place of tape, as the final storage destination.

  Which of the following elements is not included in a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)? <br></br>A. Timestamping <br></br>B. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)  <br></br>C. Certificate revocation <br></br>D. Internet Key Exchange (IKE)   Itexamworld.com  CISSP    
<br></br>","Answer: D  Explanation: Public key cryptography is one mechanism that is often used to fulfill the security requirements necessary to conduct electronic transactions over public networks. PKI (public key infrastructure) and cryptography based solutions are taking the lead in secure e-commerce. PKI addresses nonrepudiation of identity using a dual-key encryption system that allows users to uniquely sign documents with a digital signature. Public key cryptography uses pairs of keys, each pair consisting of one public key and one private key. Information encrypted with one key in the pair can only be decrypted with the other key. LDAP is issued to bring user information and Timestamping to track changes over time. PKI also relies on certificated and CRL (Certificate Revocation list) to discard compromised, expired digital certificates.   "

   Which of the following protocols is not implemented at the Internet layer of the TCP/IP protocol model?  <br></br>A. User datagram protocol (UDP) <br></br>B. Internet protocol (IP) <br></br>C. Address resolution protocol (ARP) <br></br>D. Internet control message protocol (ICMP) 
<br></br>","Answer: A Explanation: UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a communications method (protocol) that offers a limited amount of service when messages are exchanged between computers in a network that uses the Internet Protocol (IP). UDP is an alternative to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and, together with IP, is sometimes referred to as UDP/IP. Like the Transmission Control Protocol, UDP uses the Internet Protocol to actually get a data unit (called a datagram) from one computer to another. Unlike TCP, however, UDP does not provide the service of dividing a message into packets (datagrams) and reassembling it at the other end. Specifically, UDP doesn't provide sequencing of the packets that the data arrives in. UDP is implemented at the Transport layer of the TCP/IP protocol model.     Itexamworld.com  CISSP    "

   Which software development model is actually a meta-model that incorporates a number of the software development models?  Itexamworld.com  CISSP      <br></br>A. The Waterfall model. <br></br>B. The modified Waterfall model. <br></br>C. The Spiral model. <br></br>D. The Critical Patch Model (CPM). 
<br></br>","Answer: C Explanation: The spiral model for software engineering has evolved to encompass the best features of the classic waterfall model, while at the same time adding an element known as risk analysis. The spiral model is more appropriate for large, industrial software projects and has four main blocks/quadrants. Each release or version of the software requires going through new planning, risk analysis, engineering and customer evaluation phases and this is illustrated in the model by the spiral e volution outwards from the center. For each new release of a software product, a risk analysis audit should be performed to decide whether the new objectives can be completed within budget (time and costs), and decisions have to be made about whether to proceed. The level of planning and customer evaluation is missing from the waterfall model which is mainly  concerned with small software programs. The spiral model also illustrated the evolutionary development of software where a solution may be initially proposed which is very basic (first time round the loop) and then later releases add new features and possibly a more elaborate GUI.

  What is not true with pre-shared key auth entication within IKE / IPsec protocol: <br></br>A. Pre-shared key authentication is normally based on simple passwords. <br></br>B. Needs a PKI to work.  <br></br>C. Only one preshared key for all VPN connections is needed. <br></br>D. Costly key management on large user groups.  
<br></br>","Answer: B  Explanation: Pre-Shared Secret is usually us ed when both ends of the VPN lacks access to a compatible certificate server. Once you have defined all the endpoints in your VPN, you can establish a password that is used to authenticate the other end of the connection, this is the Pre-Shared secret. Since you are using Pre-Shar ed key because you don't have an available / compatible certificate server, IPSEC and IKE do not need to use PKI in this case (that actually provides the certificate server infrastructure).

<br></br>","Answer: B  Explanation: This kind of an attack involves altering the raw data just before it is processed by a computer and then changing it back after the processing is completed. This kind of attack was used in the past to make what is stated in the question, steal small quantities of money and transfer them to the attackers account. See ""Data deddling crimes"" on the Web. The most correct answer is 'Salami', but since th at is not an option the most correct answer is data diddling. ""A salami attack is committing several small crim es with the hope that the overall larger crime will go unnoticed. ....An example would be if an employee altered a banking software program to subtract 5 cents from each of the bank's customers' accounts once a month and moved this amount to the employee's bank account. If this happened to all of the bank's 50,000 customer accounts, the intruder could make up to $ 30,000 a year. Data diddling refers to the alteration of existing data. Many times this modification happens before it is entered into an application or as soon as it completes processing and is outputted from an application.

  What are suitable protocols for securing VPN connections? <br></br>A. S/MIME and SSH <br></br>B. TLS and SSL  <br></br>C. IPsec and L2TP <br></br>D. PKCS# and X.509  
<br></br>","Answer: C  Explanation: Both of them can be used to create and secure VPN's. The Layer 2 Tunnel Protocol (L2TP) is an emerging Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard that combines the best features of two existing t unneling protocols: Cisco's Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F) and Microsoft's Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP). L2TP is an extension to the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), which is an important component for VPNs. VPNs allow users and telecommuters to connect to their co rporate intranets or extranets. IPSec is a series of guidelines for the protection of Inte rnet Protocol (IP) communications. It specifies ways for securing private information transmitted over public networks. Services supported by IPSec include confidentiality (enc ryption), authenticity (proof of sender), integrity (detection of data tampering) and replay protection (defense against unauthorized re-sending of data). It work on layer 3 of the OSI model and is the most common protocols used to create VPNs.     Itexamworld.com  CISSP    "

   The primary purpose for using one-way encryption of  user passwords within a system is which of the following?  <br></br>A. It prevents an unauthorized person from trying multiple passwords in one logon attempt. <br></br>B. It prevents an unauthorized person from reading or modifying the password list. <br></br>C. It minimizes the amount of storage required for user passwords. <br></br>D. It minimizes the amount of processing time used for encrypting passwords. 
<br></br>","Answer: B Explanation: This kind of encryption flavor incr eases security for passwords, if you use a one way encryption algorithm, you know that the encryption is not reversible, you cannot get the original value that you provided as a password from the resulting hash with any key or algorithm. This increase security in the way that when a person see the password list, it will only see the hash values and cannot read the original password or modify them without getting corruption.   "

  Which Orange Book evaluation level is described as ""Structured Protection""? <br></br>A. A1 <br></br>B. B3  <br></br>C. B2 <br></br>D. B1  
<br></br>","Answer: C  Explanation: Class B2 corresponds to Structured Protection. Division B - Mandatory Protection Mandatory access is enforced by the use of s ecurity labels. The architecture is based on the Bell-LaPadula security model and evidence of the reference monitor enforcement must be available. B1: Labeled Security Each data object must c ontain a classification label and each subject must have a clearance label. When a subject attempts to access an object, the system must compare the subject and the object's security labels to en sure the requested actions are acceptable. Data leaving the system must also contain an accurate security label. The security policy is based on an informal statement and the design specifications are reviewed and verified. It is intended for environments that handle classified data. B2: Structured Protection The security policy is clearly defined and documented and the system design and implementation is subjected to more thorough review and testing procedures. This class requires more stringent authentication mechanisms and well-defined interfaces between  Itexamworld.com  CISSP    layers. Subject and devices require labels, and the system must not allow covert channels. A trusted path for logon and authentication processe s must be in place, which means there are no trapdoors. There is a separation of operator and administration functions within the system to provide more trusted and protected operational functionality. Distinct address spaces must be provided to isolated processes, and a covert channel analysis is conducted. This class adds assurance by adding requirements to the design of the system. The environment that would require B2 systems could process sensitive data that requir es a higher degree of security. This environment would require systems that are relatively resistant to penetration and compromise. B3 Security Domains In this class, more granularity is provided in each protects mechanism and the programming code that is not necessary to support the security is excluded. The design and implementation should not provide too much complexity because as the complexity of a system increases, the ability of the individuals who need to  test, maintain, and configure it reduces; thus, the overall security can be threatened. The reference monitor components must be small enough to test properly and be tamperproof. The security administrator role is clearly defined and the system must be able to recover from failures without its security level being compromised. When the system starts up and loads its operating system and components, it must be done in an initial secure state to ensure any weakness of the system cannon be taken advantage of in this slice of time. An environment that requires B3 systems is a highly secured environment that processes very sensitive information. It requires systems that are highly resistant to penetration. Note: In class (B2) systems, the TCB is based on a clearly defined and documented formal security policy model that requires the discretionary and mandatory access control enforcement found in class (B1) systems be extended to all s ubjects and objects in the ADP system. In addition, covert channels are addressed. The TCB must be carefully structured into protection-critical and non-protection-critical el ements. Class B corresponds to ""Structured Protection"" inside the Orange Book.   "

   This tape format can be used to backup data systems in addition to its original intended audio used by:  <br></br>A. Digital Audio tape (DAT) <br></br>B. Digital video tape (DVT) <br></br>C. Digital Casio Tape (DCT) <br></br>D. Digital Voice Tape (DVT)  
<br></br>","Answer: A  Explanation: Digital Audio Tape (DAT or R-DAT) is a signal recording and playback medium introduced by Sony in 1987. In appearance it is similar to a compact audio cassette, using 1/8"" magnetic tape enclosed in a protective shell, but is roughly half the size at 73 mm x 54 mm x 10.5 mm. As the name suggests the recording is digital rather than analog, DAT converting and recording at the same rate as a CD (44.1 kHz sampling rate and 16 bits quantization) without data compression. This means that the entire input signal is retained. If a digital s ource is copied then the DAT will produce an exact clone. The format was designed for audio use, but through an ISO standard it has been adopted for general data storage, storing from 4 to 40 GB on a 120 meter tape depending on the standard and compression (DDS-1 to DDS-4). It is, naturally , sequential-access media and is commonly used for backups. Due to the higher requirements for integrity in data backups a computer-grade DAT was introduced.   "

Third generation firewall systems. <br></br>D. Fourth generation firewall systems. 
<br></br>","Answer: C Explanation: Statefull inspection is a third generation firewall technology designed to be aware of, and inspect, not only the information being received, but the dynamic connection and transmission state of the information being received. Control decisions are made by analyzing and utilizing the following: Communication Information, Communication derived state, Application derived state and information manipulation. Here are some characteristics of Statefull Inspection technology on Firewalls: 1. Scan information from all layers in the packet. 2. Save state information derived from previous communications, such as the outgoing Port command of an FTP session, so that incoming data communication can be verified against it. 3. Provides tracking support for connectionless protocols through the use of session state databases. 4. Allow state information derived from other applications access through the firewall for authorized services only, such as previously authenticated users. 5. Evaluate and manipulate flexible expressions based on communication and application derived state information.   "

   The Computer Security Policy Model the Orange Book is based on is which of the following?  <br></br>A. Bell-LaPadula <br></br>B. Data Encryption Standard <br></br>C. Kerberos <br></br>D. Tempest  
<br></br>","Answer: A  Explanation: Following the publication of the Anderson report, considerable research was initiated into formal models of security policy requirements and of the mechanisms that would implement and enforce those policy models as a security kernel. Prominent among these efforts was the ESD-sponsored development of the Bell and LaPadula model, an abstract formal treatment of DoD security policy.[2] Using mathematics and set theory, the model precisely defines the notion of secure state, fundamental modes of access, and the rules for granting subjects specific modes of access to objects. Finally, a theorem is proven to demonstrate that the rules are security-preserving operations, so that the application of any sequence of the rules to a system that is in a secure state will result in the system entering a new state that is also secure. This theorem is known as the Basic Security Theorem.   "

  Which DES modes can best be used for authentication? <br></br>A. Cipher Block Chaining and Electronic Code Book. <br></br>B. Cipher Block Chaining and Output Feedback.  <br></br>C. Cipher Block Chaining and Cipher Feedback. <br></br>D. Output Feedback and Electronic Code Book.  
<br></br>","Answer: C  Explanation: Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) uses feedback to feed the result of encryption back into the encryption of the next block. The plain-text is XOR'ed with the previous cipher-text block before it is encrypted. The encryption of each block depends on all the previous blocks. This requires that the decryption side processes all encrypted blocks sequentially. This mode requires a random initialization vector which is XOR'ed with the first data block before it is encrypted. The initialization vector does not have to be kept secret. The initialization vector should be a random number (or a serial number), to ensure that each message is encrypted uniquely. In the Cipher Feedback Mode (CFB) is data encrypted in units smaller than the block size. This mode can be used to encrypt any number of bits e.g. single bits or single characters (bytes) before sending across an insecure data link. Both of those method can be best used to  provide user authentication capabilities.   "
